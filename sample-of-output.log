  "abstract": "A novel application of coal gangue as inexpensive adsorbents is considered in this study. The structural and surface properties of natural and modified gangue were studied via nitrogen adsorption. Four types of samples were studied: natural, modified with H(2)NO(3) and H(2)O(2) and calcined at 250 °C and 600 °C. The specific surface area and porosity of the samples were determined using various methods. The raw material is mainly mesoporous with relatively small specific surface area. The chemical modification enlarged the total pore volume and the specific surface area. The calcination at 250 °C enlarged slightly the pore volume and lowered the specific surface area, but did not cause significant changes in the structural properties. The calcination at 600 °C resulted in a significant increase in pore volume and a decrease in specific surface area. These results suggest that the coal gangue studied here could be used as inexpensive adsorbent in industrial wastewater pretreatment.",

  "abstract": "Physicochemical characteristics of wastewater have a relationship with the stability of TiO(2) nanoparticles (NPs). This in turn has an effect on the toxicity of TiO(2) NPs in microorganisms. In this work, the effect of TiO(2) NPs on activated sludge process was evaluated using three different types of wastewater: synthetic, raw, and filtered. The results showed that aggregate size of TiO(2) NPs and their specific adsorption of substrates were influenced by the type of substrates and the presence of suspended solids in the wastewater. It was also shown that TiO(2) NPs in raw wastewater severely inhibited oxygen uptake by microorganisms as compared to uptake in synthetic or filtered wastewater. The attachment of TiO(2) NP aggregates on cell membranes was observed for all types of wastewater. However, the internalization of TiO(2) NPs by microorganisms was observed only for raw and filtered wastewater. These results indicate that the effects caused by TiO(2) NPs on activated sludge were different depending on the wastewater used for the experiment.",

  "abstract": "In any contaminated environment, the sensitive plant species can serve as bio-indicator of air pollution while tolerant plant species can act as a sink for air pollutants. Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) is an important tool to screen out plants based on their tolerance or sensitivity level to different air pollutants. The present study was aimed to identify the sensitive and tolerant plant species in the vicinity of brick kilns in the Rawalpindi city. To determine the susceptibility level of the selected plant species, four biochemical parameters, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll content, relative water content and pH of leaf extract, were assessed and APTI was calculated. Plant sampling was carried out with increasing distance of 100, 300 and 500 m around three brick kiln sites and APTI values were calculated by following the standard methods. The results of the study revealed that among nine studied plant species, Calotropis procera (APTI = 20.05) and Althernanthera pungens (APTI = 17.13) were found to be the most tolerant species, whereas Malva neglecta (APTI = 8.83) was found to be the most sensitive species. Inconsistent trend of variations was seen in the APTI values at each site. The present study suggested that the most tolerant species, C. procera and A. pungens, could be grown in the vicinity of such pollution sources as a remedial measure of brick kiln pollution.",

  "abstract": "The green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) is a major generalist predator employed in integrated pest management (IPM) plans for pest control on many crops. Nitenpyram, a neonicotinoid insecticide has widely been used against the sucking pests of cotton in Pakistan. Therefore, a field green lacewing strain was exposed to nitenpyram for five generations to investigate resistance evolution, cross-resistance pattern, stability, realized heritability, and mechanisms of resistance. Before starting the selection with nitenpyram, a field collected strain showed 22.08-, 23.09-, 484.69- and 602.90-fold resistance to nitenpyram, buprofezin, spinosad and acetamiprid, respectively compared with the Susceptible strain. After continuous selection for five generations (G1-G5) with nitenpyram in the laboratory, the Field strain (Niten-SEL) developed a resistance ratio of 423.95 at G6. The Niten-SEL strain at G6 showed no cross-resistance to buprofezin and acetamiprid and negative cross-resistance to spinosad compared with the Field strain (G1). For resistance stability, the Niten-SEL strain was left unexposed to any insecticide for four generations (G6-G9) and bioassay results at G10 showed that resistance to nitenpyram, buprofezin and spinosad was stable, while resistance to acetamiprid was unstable. The realized heritability values were 0.97, 0.16, 0.03, and -0.16 to nitenpyram, buprofezin, acetamiprid and spinosad, respectively, after five generations of selection. Moreover, the enzyme inhibitors (PBO or DEF) significantly decreased the nitenpyram resistance in the resistant strain, suggesting that resistance was due to microsomal oxidases and esterases. These results are very helpful for integration of green lacewings in IPM programs.",

  "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) from the infective juveniles (IJs) of entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) have been investigated with respect to their susceptibility to insecticides and immunological characteristics, aiming at nominating the most compatible insecticide(s) to be used in conjunction with the most insecticide-tolerant EPN strain before incorporation in integrated pest management (IPM) programs. The inhibition kinetics of two purified AChE isoenzymes, AChEAII and AChEBI isolated from Heterorhabditid bacteriophora EM2 strain, by different insecticides revealed that the insensitivity to inhibition by such insecticides could be arranged in a descending order as; methomyl>carbofuran>acetamiprid>oxamyl>malathion. Except for malathion, the insecticides competitively inhibited AChEs with Ki values ranging from 0.1 to 15mM and IC(50) values from 1.25 to 23mM. The two AChE isoforms are several folds less sensitive to inhibition by methomyl and carbofuran compared to those previously reported for other insect species. AChEBI was used as an immunogen to raise anti-AChEBI antisera in rabbits. The prepared antisera cross-reacted with AChEs of five different heterorhabditid nematode strains implying the presence of common epitopes shared along all the examined strains. Such studies could aid in the rational selection of the compatible insecticide(s) and the prepared polyclonal anti-AChE antisera would be a valuable immunodiagnostic tool for evaluating the most insecticide-tolerant EPN strain(s) in IPM programs.",

  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To estimate the frequency and strength of fatigue in epilepsy patients. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases were searched, and hand-searched data were added. For inclusion, the studies had to be original research articles that included fatigue data from adult epilepsy patients. The strength was estimated using studies reporting fatigue scores of standardized inventories for the patients and healthy controls. The fatigue frequency was estimated based on studies reporting the number of fatigue events in patients. We also investigated risk factors for fatigue and the correlation of depression with fatigue in epilepsy patients. RESULTS: Of 25,613 abstracts screened, we included 12 articles or proceedings with distinctive data. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was the most commonly used inventory for fatigue in epilepsy patients. Four studies compared FSS scores between 499 epilepsy patients and 295 healthy controls. The overall mean difference in the FSS scores was significant. Seven of the 12 studies reported the frequency of fatigue determined by the FSS for 700 epilepsy patients. As stated by the studies, the overall frequency of fatigue was 47.1%. The risk factors for fatigue in epilepsy patients were depression, sleep-related impairment, and sleep quality. Of the 12 studies, 7 revealed a significant correlation between depression and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is common in epilepsy patients and is closely correlated with depression. The identification and management of fatigue and its risk factors, especially depression, is mandatory for the management of epilepsy.",

  "abstract": "All of the lower alkyl methacrylates are high production chemicals with potential for human exposure. The genotoxicity of seven mono-functional alkyl esters of methacrylic acid, i.e. methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, n-, i- and t-butyl methacrylate and 2 ethyl hexyl methacrylate, as well as methacrylic acid itself, the acyl component common to all, is reviewed and compared with the lack of carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate, the representative member of the series so evaluated. Also reviewed are the similarity of structure, chemical and biological reactivity, metabolism and common metabolic products of this group of compounds which allows a category approach for assessing genotoxicity. As a class, the lower alkyl methacrylates are universally negative for gene mutations in prokaryotes but do exhibit high dose clastogenicity in mammalian cells in vitro. There is no convincing evidence that these compounds induce genotoxic effects in vivo in either sub-mammalian or mammalian species. This dichotomy of effects can be explained by the potential genotoxic intermediates generated in vitro. This genotoxic profile of the lower alkyl methacrylates is consistent with the lack of carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate.",

  "abstract": "A highly sensitive nanosensing method for the combined selective capture and SERS detection of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in blood plasma has been developed. The new method utilizes gold coated magnetic nanoparticles that are functionalized with anti MC-LR antibody Fab' fragments for the selective capture of MC-LR from aqueous media and blood plasma. Using an oriented immobilization approach, the Fab' fragments are covalently attached to gold surface to form a monolayer with high capture efficiency towards the toxin. After the selective capture, the purified MC-LR molecules were released from the extractor nanoparticles within 5min by manipulating the pH environment of the nanoparticles. The regenerated extractor nanoparticles maintained their capture efficiency and, therefore, were re-used to capture of MC-LR from successive samples. The released purified toxin was screened within 10min on gold coated silicon nanopillars and a new paper-based SERS substrate by handheld Raman spectrometer. The SERS enhancement factors of the nanopillars and the new paper-based substrate were 2.5×10(6) and 3×10(5) respectively. The lower limit of quantification (LOQ) of MC-LR by SERS on the nanopillar substrate was 10fM (R(2)=0.9975) which is well below the clinically required detection limit of the toxin. The SERS determination of MC-LR was cross validated against ELISA. By using antibody fragments that are specific to the target biomolecule, the new methodology can be extended to the rapid extraction and detection of other toxins and proteins.",

  "abstract": "Osteogenic protein (OP)-1 delivery into discs has achieved some success in disc regeneration in animals, though conflicting outcomes exist. This study aimed to systematically review the animal studies that assessed the effect of OP-1 on disc regeneration. Relevant literature was searched in the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM). Animal species, disc degeneration model, OP-1 delivery method, and follow-up methodology including disc histology, disc matrix alteration, disc height, MRI T2 signal intensity and OP-1 treatment complications were extracted and reviewed. Among 15 eligible studies, direct OP-1 protein injection into the disc was reported in 10 studies whereas cell-based or viral-based OP-1 gene transfer into the disc was reported in 5 studies. Although one study using a spontaneous canine disc degeneration model reported negative findings, all other studies (10 in rabbit, 1 in canine and 3 in rat) indicated that OP-1 delivery was effective in retarding disc degeneration and regenerating discs. The adverse effect of OP-1 delivery (i.e., extradiscal new bone formation) was reported in one study. In conclusion, OP-1 delivery offers a feasible option to biologically treat degenerated discs in animals, especially in rodent rabbit and rat models. However, more animal studies are needed to test the safety of the current OP-1 delivery means. Additionally, care should be taken when OP-1 delivery is used to treat human disc degeneration due to the differences between human and animal discs.",

  "abstract": "For the first time, for 2013-2014, as part of ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, data for fluoride concentrations in water and plasma for U.S. children and adolescents were released in the public domain. This study was undertaken to investigate how fluoride concentrations vary in water and plasma with age, gender, race/ethnicity, housing ownership, use of prescription fluoride drops and/or tablets, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and recent use of tobacco products (among adolescents). Fluoride concentrations in water were found to be lower among those aged 3-5 years than those aged 6-11 years (p=0.02), lower for non-Hispanic Asians than Hispanics (p=0.04) among 3-5 years old, lower for non-Hispanic Asians than non-Hispanic blacks (p=0.04) among 6-11 years old, and lower for those who used prescription fluoride drops and/or tablets than those who did not (p≤0.048) among 12-19 years old. Adjusted fluoride concentrations in plasma were found to be lower for females than males (p<0.01) among those aged 6-11 years, lower for Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites (p<0.01) among those aged 12-19 years, and lower for those who used prescription fluoride drops and/or tablets than those who did not (p=0.03) among 12-15 years old. Recent smokers were found to have higher fluoride concentration (p=0.03) in plasma than non-smoker adolescents. Over 60% of the children aged 6-11 years and adolescents aged 12-19 years were at the risk of developing dental caries/decay. About 30% of the children were at the risk of dental fluorosis.",

  "abstract": "A comparative study is reported where folic acid (FA) and boronic acid (BA) based cytosensors and their analytical performances in cancer cell detection were analyzed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. Cytosensors were fabricated using self-assembled monolayer principle by modifying Au electrode with cysteamine (Cys) and immobilization of ferrocene cored polyamidiamine dendrimers second generation (Fc-PAMAM (G2)), after which electrodes were modified with FA and BA. Au/Fc-PAMAM(G2)/FA and Au/Fc-PAMAM(G2)/BA based cytosensors showed extremely good analytical performances in cancer cell detection with linear range of 1×10(2) to 1×10(6)cellsml(-1), detection limit of 20cellsml(-1) with incubation time of 20min for FA based electrode, and for BA based electrode detection limit was 28cellsml(-1) with incubation time of 10min. Next to excellent analytical performances, cytosensors showed high selectivity towards cancer cells which was demonstrated in selectivity study using human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) as normal cells and Au/Fc-PAMAM(G2)/FA electrode showed two times better selectivity than BA modified electrode. These cytosensors are promising for future applications in cancer cell diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "The flowers of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of ischemic diseases. The present study is to investigate whether total flavones (TA) of extracted from Abelmoschus manihot L. Medic has the potential cardioprotective effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in rats. The index of myocardial injury, inflammatory biomarkers and NLRP3-related parameters were measured, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to I/R group, TA reduced myocardial infarction area, declined serum creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, attenuated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) production. Moreover, TA markedly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced the amounts of malondialdehyde (MDA) in I/R rats. In addition, TA reduced myocardial I/R induced injury in rats by inhibiting NLRPR3 inflammasome. Thus, it is assumed that TA could significantly improve myocardial I/R injury in rats partially through suppressing NLRP3 activtion.",

  "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the effects of miR-200c binding to fibronectin 1 (FN1) on proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer (GC) cells. A total of 52 GC tissues and their corresponding normal adjacent tissue samples were collected. Then, miR-200c and FN1 were tested using quantitative real-time RT-PCR in the clinical specimens and GC cells, while immunohistochemistry and western blotting assay were carried out to detect FN1 expressions. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to assess the effect of miR-200c on the luciferase activity of FN1 3'UTR. BGC-823 cells were transfected with miR-200c mimics, miR-200c inhibitors and FN1 siRNA, respectively. The effects of miR-200c inhibitors and FN1 siRNA on cellular proliferation, migration and invasion were detected through MTT assay and Transwell assay. Compared to normal tissues and cells, miR-200c was significantly down-regulated and FN1 was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01). Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-200c could specifically bind to the 3'-UTR of FN1 and significantly repress the luciferase activity (P<0.01). Both mRNA and protein expressions of FN1 were decreased significantly in GC cells when miR-200c was over expressed. The proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells could be suppressed by over-expression of miR-200c or down-regulation of FN1. In conclusion, miR-200c was significantly down-regulated in both GC tissues and cell lines, while FN1 presented the opposite trends. Besides, miR-200c inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells through binding to FN1.",

  "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is an innate immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) against metabolic and pathogenic toxic wastes. The main hypothesis implies that a state of hyperammonemia which is accountable for both direct and indirect modification in ammonia metabolism with an elevated production of inflammatory cytokines. This study was constructed to explore the modulating effect of chrysin on rudimentary pathophysiologic mechanisms of ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) mediated neuroinflammation in the experimental hyperammonemic rats. NH(4)Cl was injected intraperitonally (i.p) in male albino wistar rats for a time period of thrice a week for eight consecutive weeks. Initially, the levels of brain ammonia and water content were assessed. Immunohistochemical, RT-PCR and western blotting analysis revealed that the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) were down-regulated, whereas the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, p65 NF-κB, iNOS and COX-2 were up-regulated in brain tissue of hyperammonemic rats. Oral supplementation of chrysin (100mg/kg b.w) to hyperammonemic rats considerably restored the levels of brain ammonia, water content, and the expressions of GS, GFAP, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, p65 NF-κB, iNOS and COX-2. Our findings provided substantial evidence that the chrysin synergistically attenuating the neuroinflammatory mechanism by repressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulating the astrocytic protein expressions via ammonia-reducing strategies. This data suggests that chrysin effectively acts as a therapeutic agent to treat hyperammonemia mediated neuroinflammation.",

  "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play an important role in estimating the presence and the metastatic relapse of tumor. Despite of their importance, isolation of viable CTCs is still struggling, since chemical or mechanical damages are unavoidable when separating less than 1000 of CTCs out of billions of other blood components. Furthermore, the current CTC isolation devices show low productivity, since they are produced after a series of complicated fabrication processes. Here, we present a low-cost and mass-producible fabric filters for the viable CTC isolation and the further molecular assay for profiling cancer-associated markers. The fabric filter, produced by polyester monofilament yarns, can be massively produced at extremely low-cost, by showing productivity of ~22filters/s at ~59filters/USD. By utilizing size-based sorting method, the fabric filter is capable to isolate both epithelial and mesenchymal CTCs, while slots with curved walls are beneficial for preventing the cell rupture by reducing 21.6% of mechanical stress compared to the conventional straight-walled slots. We applied our filter to 11 human blood samples and found that the number of CTCs was closely related to the expression level of Ki-67, which is highly overexpressed in proliferative tumors. The fabric filter might be an appropriate caner-screening tool in developing countries, where people suffer from insufficient healthcare services.",

  "abstract": "Ion sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFET) are the basis of radical new sensing approaches. Reliable molecular characterization of specific detection of DNA and/or RNA is vital for disease diagnostics and to follow up alterations in gene expression profiles. Devices and strategies for biomolecular recognition and detection should be developed into reliable and inexpensive platforms. Here, we describe the development of a flexible thin-film sensor for label free gene expression analysis. A charge modulated ISFET based sensor was integrated with real-time DNA/RNA isothermal nucleic acid amplification: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) techniques for c-MYC and BCR-ABL1 genes, allowing for the real-time quantification of template. Also, RCA allowed the direct quantification of RNA targets at room temperature, eliminating the requirement for external temperature controllers and overall complexity of the molecular diagnostic approach. This integration between the biological and the sensor/electronic approaches enabled the development of an inexpensive and direct gene expression-profiling platform.",

  "abstract": "A novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal-amplified immunosensing strategy was proposed by using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) capped Fe(3)O(4) (Au-FrGO). In this work, CeO(2)@TiO(2) was prepared by a sol-gel method to wrap CeO(2) with TiO(2). In the presence of CeO(2), CeO(2)@TiO(2) exhibited better ECL activity than TiO(2) with peroxydisulfate as coreactant. In addition, FrGO with macroporous structure was synthesized by self-assembly of rGO sheets capped cationic Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, exhibiting larger specific surface area than rGO. Due to the low toxicity and magnetism of Fe(3)O(4), FrGO owned more favorable biocompatibility and the application of magnetic-separation simplified the preparation procedure. After hybridizing with Au NPs, FrGO exhibited more excellent electrical conductivity and could immobilize more CeO(2)@TiO(2) and antibodies. Therefore, a novel label-free ECL immunosensor based on Au-FrGO-CeO(2)@TiO(2) was constructed which generated higher ECL response. To investigate the performance of the immunosensor, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was chosen as a model target analyte. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor had sensitive response to CEA in a wide linear range of 0.01pgmL(-1) to 10ngmL(-1) with a detection limit of 3.28 fg mL(-1). The proposed ECL immunosensor exhibited excellent stability, repeatability and selectivity, which opened another promising avenue for CEA determination in real serum samples.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: URB597 is a compound largely linked to the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme responsible for the metabolic degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Despite this pharmacological property accounts for its modulatory profile demonstrated in some neurotoxic paradigms, the possible protective properties of this agent have been poorly investigated, and deserve exploration in different neurotoxic models. In this study, we explored the effects of URB597 on oxidative damage to lipids and other major endpoints of toxicity in two neurotoxic models in vivo in rats (the first one produced by the mitochondrial neurotoxin 3-nitropropionic acid [3-NP], and the other generated by the striatal injection of the pro-oxidant toxin 6-hydroxidopamine [6-OHDA]) in order to provide further supporting evidence of its modulatory profile. METHODS: Male Wistar adult rats were treated for 5 or 7 consecutive days with URB597 (0.3mg/kg, i.p.) and simultaneously exposed to three injections of 3-NP (30mg/kg, i.p.) or a single intrastriatal infusion of 6-OHDA (0.02mg/2μl), respectively. Twenty four hours after all treatments were administered, lipid peroxidation was measured in the striatum of 3-NP-treated rats, and in the midbrain of 6-OHDA-treated rats. Motor skills and histological assessment in the striatum were also evaluated in 3-NP-treated rats 6 and 7days after the last drug administration, respectively; whereas apomorphine-induced circling behavior and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolocalization in the striatum and substantia nigra were investigated 21 and 22days after the last drug infusion, respectively. RESULTS: URB597 prevented the oxidative damage to lipids induced by 3-NP in the striatum, and this effect could account for the attenuation of motor deficits in this model. Attenuation of motor disturbances induced by URB597 in both models was associated with the morphological preservation of the striatum in the 3-NP model and the partial preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the 6-OHDA model in the SNpc and striatum. CONCLUSION: The modulatory actions exerted by URB597 in both toxic models support its potential against toxic conditions implying motor and neurochemical alterations linked to energy depletion, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Although most of these effects could be attributable to its action on FAAH and further AEA accumulation, in light of our present findings other properties are suggested.",

  "abstract": "Dengue virus is an arthropod-borne virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitos and is major cause of disease in tropical and subtropical regions. Colloquially known as Dengue Fever, infection can cause hemorrhagic disorders and death in humans and non-human primates. We report a novel electronic biosensor based on a single-walled carbon nanotube network chemiresistive transducer that is functionalized with heparin for low-cost, label-free, ultra-sensitive, and rapid detection of whole dengue virus (DENV). Heparin, an analog of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are receptors for dengue virus during infection of Vero cells and hepatocytes, was used for the first time in a biosensor as a biorecognition element instead of traditional antibody. Detection of DENV in viral culture supernatant has similar sensitivity as the corresponding viral titer in phosphate buffer despite the presence of growth media and Vero cell lysate. The biosensor demonstrated sensitivity within the clinically relevant range for humans and infected Aedes aegypti. It has potential application in clinical diagnosis and can improve point-of-care diagnostics of dengue infection.",

  "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscular atrophy. SMA is caused by deletions or mutations in the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1) on chromosome 5q13. A second copy of the SMN gene (SMN2) also exists on chromosome 5, and both genes can produce functional protein. However, due to alternative splicing of the exon 7, the majority of SMN protein produced by SMN2 is truncated and unable to compensate for the loss of SMN1. Increasing full-length SMN protein production by promoting the exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 mRNA or increasing SMN2 gene transcription could be a therapeutic approach for SMA. In this study, we screened for the compounds that enhance SMN2 exon 7 inclusion by using SMN2 minigene-luciferase reporter system. We found that securinine can increase luciferase activity, indicating that securinine promoted SMN2 exon 7 inclusion. In addition, securinine increased full-length SMN2 mRNA and SMN protein expression in SMA patient-derived lymphoid cell lines. To investigate the mechanism of securinine effect on SMN2 splicing, we compared the protein levels of relevant splicing factors between securinine-treated and untreated cells. We found that securinine downregulated hnRNP A1 and Sam68 and upregulated Tra2-β1 expression. However, securinine, unlike HDAC inhibitors, did not enhance tra2-β1 gene transcription, indicating a post-transcriptional mechanism for Tra2-β1 upregulation. Furthermore, we treated SMA-like mice with securinine by i.p. injection and found that securinine treatment increased SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein expression in the brain and spinal cord. According to our results, securinine might have the potential to become a therapeutic drug for SMA disease.",

  "abstract": "The food processing industry generates huge volumes of waste and co-products which still contain valuable compounds. Tiger-nut milk production generates large amounts of a co-product with a high insoluble fibre content, which is interesting as a bioactive component from a nutritional viewpoint. This co-product is formed by two different tissues in composition, particle size and colour terms, so two different flours were obtained from them. Both flours were included in a wheat-based matrix at different substitution levels: 5%, 10% and 20% (d.b). The surface tension of matrices, and the wettability and diffusion of water and oil, were studied. The results showed the matrix's reduced capacity to interact with solvents, principally from the 10% substitution level, with diminished surface tension, and a longer time was needed for both water and oil to wet and diffuse.",

  "abstract": "Oil-in-water microemulsions (O/W MEs) allow the preparation of insoluble compounds into liquid. In this study, we prepared O/W MEs to improve the solubility and stability of steppogenin (S) in aqueous liquid, and studied their ability to inhibit fresh apple juice browning. The ME technique greatly increased steppogenin solubility up to 3000-fold higher than that in water. All SMEs demonstrated good stability after acceleration and long-term storage. In particular, 0.01% SME was associated with dramatic inhibition of fresh apple juice browning after 24h at room temperature and 7days at 4°C, and its antibrowning effects were further improved when combined with 0.05% ascorbic acid. On the other hand, simultaneous encapsulation of steppogenin with vitamin E or butylated hydroxytoluene into ME did not greatly improve SME antibrowning effects. Taken together, these results suggested that steppogenin might serve as a potential antibrowning agent to preserve fresh apple juice.",

  "abstract": "In recent years, a large number of insect repellents have been developed with the idea of consumer benefits. In addition to already known advantageous application of insect repellents, there is increasing concern about the potential toxicity in environment leading to health caused by random use of these compounds. An increasing number of evidence suggests that insect repellents may trigger undesirable hazardous interactions with biological systems with a potential to generate harmful effects including intermediate metabolites. Biotransformation followed by bioaccumulation (vice e versa) may be an important phenomenon for toxic response of this chemicals. In this review, we have summarized the current state of knowledge on the insect repellent toxicity, including biochemical pathway alteration under in vitro and in vivo conditions considering different classes of organisms, from lower to higher vertebrate. Furthermore, we have tried to incorporate the effects of insect repellent in light of some clinical reports. We hope this review would provide useful information on potential side effects of uncontrolled use of insect repellents.",

  "abstract": "Acute hepatic dysfunction associating sepsis is mediated mainly by toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) inflammatory pathway. This study explores potential hepatoprotective effect of the NF-κB inhibitor celastrol in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model in rats. Protective effect of celastrol (1mg/kg, i.p., 1h before CLP) was illustrated after 24h by preventing CLP-induced hepatic histopathological changes and elevation in serum hepatic biomarkers [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB) and gamma aminotransferase (γ-GT)] without affecting mortality. Celastrol anti-inflammatory effect was illustrated by inhibiting increased serum and hepatic mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) without affecting IL-10 elevation. Furthermore, celastrol inhibited CLP-induced elevations in hepatic mRNA expression of nuclear factor inhibitory protein kappa-B alpha (NFκBia), TLR-4, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and prevented NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation and activation. In conclusion, celastrol prevented CLP-induced acute hepatic dysfunction through its anti-inflammatory effect by attenuating NF-κB activation, TLR-4 and 5-LOX expression with subsequent reduction in pro-inflammatory IL-6.",

  "abstract": "Carbon nanofibers (CNF) are versatile nanomaterials that are widely used in various fields of science and technology. As a consequence, animals as well as humans may be exposed to such compounds via different routes. We hypothesized that oral intake of CNF will lead to an inflammatory reaction and consequently induce behavioral impairments. To address this issue, rats were fed with 500mg/kgCNF for 14days and their locomotor activity, emotional status and cognition were quantified by testing the animals in an open field set-up, elevated plus maze and in the universal problem solving box which provides information about motivation and cognition. The behavioral tests were performed 3 times within 10days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected and the plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-18 were measured. Our results demonstrated an inflammatory reaction determined by a significantly elevated IL-6 concentration. This, however, was counteracted by an even more pronounced increase in IL-10. The behavioral effects were restricted mainly to a decrease in locomotor activity which was significant in the open field test, as well as the elevated plus maze. Other parameters indicative of cognitive performance were not influenced and also the emotional status was largely unaffected. In conclusion, our results revealed that oral intake of 500mg/kgCNF induced some adverse effects, which, however, can be still partially compensated by the organism.",

  "abstract": "Exposure to particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter≤2.5μm (PM2.5) induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to airway epithelial injury. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of PM2.5 have not been clarified. Here, we show that exposure to PM2.5 induces sustained activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in human airway epithelial Beas-2B (B2B) cells. In addition, PM2.5 exposure significantly decreased miR-331 expression in B2B cells, which was abrogated by inhibition of ROS or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Induction of miR-331 overexpression attenuated the PM2.5 exposure-induced NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, IL-6 and IL-8 expression in B2B cells. Furthermore, miR-331 targeted the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase beta (IKK-β) by down-regulating the IKK-β-regulated luciferase activity in HEK293 cells. Moreover, induction of miR-331 over-expression inhibited IKK-β expression while induction of IKK-β over-expression prevented the inhibition of miR-331 on the PM2.5 exposure-induced NF-kBp65 nuclear translocation, IL-6 and IL-8 expression in B2B cells. Therefore, PM2.5 exposure decreased miR-331 expression via the ROS/PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in an increase in the IKK-β expression and sustained NF-κB activation in human airway epithelial cells. Our findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of PM2.5 exposure and aid in design of new therapeutic strategies to prevent PM2.5-induced toxicity.",

The scope of this study was to investigate the direct effects of silver nanoparticles exposure on the membrane permeability of sheep parietal pleura, of primary sheep pleural cell monolayers and on a human mesothelial cell line. Our findings suggest that acute (30min) exposure increases the pleural permeability ex vivo, while longer (24h) exposure in vivo leads to late decrease of the pleural cell monolayers permeability.",

  "abstract": "There remain more questions than answers regarding the manifestation of certain diseases, such as Ebola, in some otherwise healthy individuals but not in others. Sasang medicine offers a possible clue to solving this mystery by introducing a constitutionally based, intrinsic approach to determining disease susceptibility. The Sasang constitution is identified by a detailed examination of inherent physiological and psychological traits that are likely, but not yet, to be associated with specific genetic patterns. Hence, it is anticipated that after further examination, the Sasang model will contribute to the advancement of medical research and treatment by establishing genetically traceable psychological and physiological traits that contribute to, or offer protection against, various diseases. To progress along this journey, additional research involving Sasang-based organ-associated emotions and inherent emotional/physiological inclinations is warranted. This study presents an argument in favor of additionally examining constitutionally specific disease components related to viral epidemiology.",

  "abstract": "Edema is an accumulation of an excessive amount of watery fluid in cells or intercellular tissues. In order to examine the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on edema, seven subjects were randomly divided into three groups, that was a Control group, an Acupuncture group (Acp), and an acupuncture and moxibustion group (Acp-Mox). After sitting for 60 minutes keeping their bodies still, the Acp and Acp-Mox subjects were administered acupuncture or acupuncture/moxibustion on the points of Zusanli (ST-36) and Sanyinjiao (SP-6), separately as against the Control group who only lied on the bed after modelization. After modelization at 60 minutes, the skin temperature and blood flow of all the groups were significantly lower in blood flow when compared with premodelization. But shortly after the procedure at 80 minutes, skin temperature in the Acp and Acp-Mox groups were significantly increased when compared with premodelization (vs. 60 minutes, p < 0.05). Moreover, the skin temperature and blood flow of the Acp-Mox group were significantly increased as compared to both the Control and the Acp group at the 80-minute time point. These results indicate that Acp and Mox-Acp could relieve edematous conditions significantly, especially the procedure of moxibustion with warming needle, was effective in improving edema which is often accompanied with cold intolerance and would be a recommended and superior therapy for edema.",

  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to find out the effect of intravenous pharmacopuncture on hepatic recovery after partial hepatectomy in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal group, control group, saline group, and two experimental groups. Except for those in the normal group, the rats underwent partial hepatectomy. Those in the control group did not receive any treatment. Those in the saline group received an intravenous injection with saline. Those in the two experimental groups received intravenous pharmacopuncture with SihoJigak-tang or DanchiSoyo-san extracts (10 mg/kg). Serum total bilirubin and liver regeneration rate were measured on Day 7 after partial hepatectomy. Intravenous pharmacopuncture with SihoJigak-tang significantly increased the liver regeneration rate, and intravenous pharmacopuncture with DanchiSoyo-san significantly decreased serum total billirubin after partial hepatectomy.",

  "abstract": "Sensory loss in a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) can be described as an injury that removes the ability of the brain to receive electrical afferent signals generated below the site of the injury. The sensory nervous system appears to be the same as the meridians in the concept of Oriental medicine, thus, we assumed that a complete SCI would lead to discontinuation of the meridians in humans. In this case series report with a cross-sectional view, we observed quantitative changes in heart rate variability induced by laser acupuncture at bilateral GB34 and ST36 points for 15 minutes in eight patients with complete SCIs between the levels of T8 and T12, and eight healthy individuals as a control group. A comparison between pre- and post-treatment data demonstrated that the physiological effect on the heart rate variability was absent when the laser acupuncture was applied below the level of injury among the patients with complete SCI, while the healthy counterparts showed the opposite pattern. The preliminary data suggest that the purported meridian system may not be different from the known sensory nervous system, as the transected spinal cord leads to interrupted meridians. The findings in the present case series warranted further investigation.",

  "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses many different practices, most notably acupuncture and moxibustion. Traditionally, these modalities are used in combination to augment treatment but seldom are they tested together in clinical studies. Numerous acupuncture studies have been conducted in Asia, Europe, and the United States but there have been few randomized controlled trials utilizing moxibustion outside of East Asia. Limited studies have described the use of a moxibustion control or placebo procedure. The methods for developing an acupuncture and moxibustion protocol used in a randomized controlled trial for irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea predominant in adults are described here. Our approach conformed to the scientific rigor for a clinical trial and was consistent to the foundations of traditional Chinese medicine.",

  "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive research. INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: Survey research was performed to determine if there is a perceived difference in outcomes of patients referred to hand therapy from specialized hand surgeons vs nonspecialized physicians. METHODS: The survey was administered to members of the American Society of Hand Therapists through an electronic mailing. RESULTS: A total of 744 American Society of Hand Therapists members responded to the survey. Therapists reported a difference in recovery time between patients referred by a hand surgeon vs a nonspecialized physician. Sixty-seven percent (n = 490) of the respondents answered yes and 12% (n = 84) answered no. DISCUSSION: It is important to consider that not all hand patients receive treatment from a specialized hand surgeon and that a specialized hand therapist may be an integral team member for patients who have not received specialized care from their referral source. CONCLUSION: Most hand therapists who responded to this survey believe that there is a difference in outcomes of patients referred to hand therapy from specialized hand surgeons vs nonspecialized physicians. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.",

  "abstract": "The assembly of a surfactant-based rotaxane by adding the labile aquopentacyanoferrate(II) ion to the previously formed pseudorotaxane between the surfactant 11-(isonicotinoyloxy)-N,N,N-triethyl-1-undecanaminium bromide and β-cyclodextrin was investigated by (1)H NMR and kinetic measurements. NMR spectroscopy has showed that the rotaxane can be formed through two different mechanisms. The rotaxane can be unstoppered by using the pyridine ligand substitution reaction by the high-field cyanide ligand. In this work a new method is developed for the preparation of several new surfactant-based rotaxanes by changing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surfactants and the nature of the macrocycle.",
